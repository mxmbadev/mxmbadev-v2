card_description: 'I facilitated the migration of a Statamic website from AISN servers to a local Windows server. I also helped set up a modern development environment using Azure DevOps and implemented Git version control, conducting training sessions to familiarize colleagues with Git workflows. Additionally, I contributed to the successful migration of the Statamic site to a WordPress platform and led the wireframing and redesign of the existing website.'
